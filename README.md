# 🚀 Advanced API Deployment in Google Colab with Ngrok  

## **📖 Introduction**  
This document provides a concise guide to setting up and running an **advanced API in Google Colab**, using **Ngrok for secure tunneling**. The project leverages **machine learning techniques** to predict **machine downtime** using manufacturing datasets. Follow these steps to ensure an **efficient setup** and **seamless operation**.

---

## **⚡ Prerequisites**  
Before getting started, ensure you have:  
✔ **A Google account** to access Google Colab.  
✔ **Basic knowledge** of Python and Colab notebooks.  
✔ **A free or paid Ngrok account** for tunneling.  

---

## **🛠 Setting Up the Environment**  

### 🔹 **1. Uninstall Outdated Ngrok Version**  
Ensure compatibility by **removing older versions** of Ngrok pre-installed in Colab.  

### 🔹 **2. Install Latest Pyngrok Version**  
Upgrade to the **latest Pyngrok version** to avoid conflicts and gain access to new features.  

### 🔹 **3. Authenticate Ngrok**  
Retrieve your **authentication token** from the Ngrok **dashboard** and set it up in Colab.  

---

## **🚀 Running the API**  

### 🔹 **1. Start Your API**  
Ensure your **Flask app** or API is **configured to run** on a specific port (e.g., **5000**).  

### 🔹 **2. Establish an Ngrok Tunnel**  
Create a **public URL** for your API by **initiating a secure Ngrok tunnel**.  

### 🔹 **3. Access the API**  
Use the **generated public URL** to **test** or **share your API**. The URL remains **active** as long as the Colab session is running.  

---

## **🎯 Example Use Case**  
### **Scenario:** You’ve built a simple **Flask app** and want to expose it online for testing.  
✔ **Run the app locally** on port **5000**  
✔ **Use Ngrok** to generate a **secure public URL**  
✔ **Share the URL** with collaborators or test it using **Postman**
